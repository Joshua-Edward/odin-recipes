    <!--Description-->
    <p>Coconut curry is one of those comforting flavors we can't live without. Our chefs 
      indulged that craving, and this one dresses up ramen noodles and a slurry of veggies, 
      including bell pepper and mushrooms. We wouldn't leave you without a little crunch 
      on your stir fry, either: sweet and savory peanuts. We're pretty sure this is one 
      veggie noodle dish you'll go nuts over.</p>

    <!--Ingredients-->
    <ul>
      <li>1 Bell Pepper Red</li>
      <li>4 Ounces Button Mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 Clove Garlic</li>
      <li>1 Lime</li>
      <li>1/4 Ounce Cilantro</li>
      <li>1/2 Ounce Peanuts</li>
      <li>6 Ounces Ramen Noodles</li>
      <li>5 to 6 Ounce Coconut Milk</li>
      <li>1 Pack Veggie Pho Stock Concentrate</li>
      <li>1 Ounce Sweet Thai Chili Sauce</li>
      <li>1 TBS Curry Powder</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Instructions-->
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. Halve, core, 
        and thinly slice bell pepper into strips. Trim and thinly slice mushrooms. Peel 
        and mince garlic. Quarter lime. Roughly chop cilantro. Roughly chop peanuts or 
        crush in their bag with a heavy-bottomed pan.</li>
      <li>Once water is boiling, add ¾ of the noodles (save the rest for another use) to 
        pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 1-2 minutes. Drain and rinse 
        noodles under cold water for at least 30 seconds. Toss noodles with a drizzle 
        of oil; set aside. (Keep empty pot handy for next step.)</li>
      <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in empty pot used for noodles over medium-high heat. Add 
        bell pepper and mushrooms; season with ¼ tsp salt (½ tsp for 4 servings) and a 
        pinch of pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and tender, 5-7 
        minutes.</li>
      <li>Add a drizzle of oil to pot with veggies and reduce heat to medium. Add garlic; 
        cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in chili sauce, stock concentrate, 
        half the coconut milk (you'll use more later), and half the curry powder (all 
        for 4 servings)</li>
      <li>Add drained noodles and ¼ tsp sugar (½ tsp for 4 servings). If needed, stir in 
        splashes of remaining coconut milk until everything is thoroughly coated in 
        sauce. Remove pot from heat; stir in juice from half the lime. Taste and season 
        with salt and pepper if needed.</li>
      <li> Divide stir-fry between bowls. Top with cilantro, peanuts, and a squeeze of 
        lime juice. Serve with any remaining lime wedges on the side.</li>
    </ol>
