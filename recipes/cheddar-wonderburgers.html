    <!--Description-->
    <p>What puts the “wonder” in “wonderburger,” you ask? It's all in the texture! 
      To achieve crispy, craggy edges, we form ground beef into balls, then press down 
      in a hot pan with a spatula to create super-thin patties. In the last few minutes 
      of cooking, we top them with gooey white cheddar, then sandwich each between a 
      potato bun with caramelized onion. A homemade special sauce is perfect for pairing 
      with the Old Bay fries on the side—and will elicit major “oohs” and “ahhs” from 
      your dining companions.</p>

    <!--Ingredients-->
    <ul>
      <li>1 Yellow Onion</li>
      <li>12 Ounces Yukon Gold Potatoes</li>
      <li>1 pack OLD BAY Seasoning</li>
      <li>2 TBS Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 TBS Ketchup</li>
      <li>2 tsp Dejon Mustard</li>
      <li>10 Ounces Ground Beef</li>
      <li>1/2 Cup White Ceddar Cheese</li>
      <li>2 Potato Buns</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Instructions-->
    <ol>
      <li>Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. 
        Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion.</li>
      <li>Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil and half the OLD BAY® 
        Seasoning (you'll use more later). Season lightly with salt and pepper. TIP: No 
        need to season generously— there's already salt and pepper in the seasoning! Roast 
        on top rack until browned and crispy, 20-25 minutes.</li>
      <li>While potatoes roast, heat a large drizzle of oil in a medium, preferably nonstick, 
        pan over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and 
        softened, 8-10 minutes. Add 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4 servings) and a splash of 
        water; cook until onion is caramelized and jammy, 2-3 minutes more. Season with 
        salt and pepper. Turn off heat; transfer to a small bowl.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, in a second small bowl, combine mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and as 
        much remaining OLD BAY® Seasoning as you like. Set aside. Form beef* into two 
        equal-sized balls (four balls for 4 servings); season all over with salt and 
        pepper.</li>
      <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for onion over medium-high heat. Once pan is 
        hot, add beef. Firmly flatten each ball with a spatula to create very thin patties. 
        (TIP: Do so carefully; oil may splatter a bit.) Cook to desired doneness, 3-4 
        minutes per side. (Don't worry if the patties aren't perfectly round—those irregular 
        edges will turn crispy.) In the last 1-2 minutes of cooking, top patties with 
        cheddar; cover until cheese melts. Remove from heat.</li>
      <li>While patties cook, halve and toast buns. • Divide buns between plates and fill 
        with patties, caramelized onion, and half the special sauce. Serve Old Bay fries 
        on the side with remaining special sauce for dipping.</li>
